`graphql-up` is the fastest way to get a free & ready to use GraphQL API. It works out of the box with Apollo & Relay and supports GraphQL subscriptions.

## Features

* üöÄ  Get a instant **GraphQL API for your schema**
* ‚öõÔ∏è  Optimized endpoints for Apollo & Relay
* üë®‚Äçüè´  Easy to add to your own tutorials, docs & examples


## Quickstart

```graphql
type Tweet {
  id: ID! @isUnique
  text: String!
  author: User! @relation(name: "Tweets")
}

type User {
  id: ID! @isUnique
  name: String!
  tweets: [Tweet!]! @relation(name: "Tweets")
}
```

Copy the schema above and save it as `twitter.graphql`. ([Read more about the IDL syntax](https://www.graph.cool/docs/faq/graphql-schema-definition-idl-kr84dktnp0/).)

```sh
# Install the CLI via npm (or yarn)
npm install -g graphql-up

# Create GraphQL API using your local schema file
graphql-up twitter.graphql
```

This is how it should look like ([see this video tutorial for more details](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWS7SGcp7cY)):

    More examples: https://github.com/graphcool/graphql-up

  Options:
    --version, -v   Print version of graphql-up
    --help, -h      Show help message
    --minimal, -m   Only print URLs of created API

```

### Local schema file

```sh
graphql-up twitter.graphql
```

### Hosted schema file


```sh
graphql-up https://graphqlbin.com/twitter.graphql
```

## How it works

You only need to provide the schema, graphql-up will create a GraphQL API for you. The actual magic happens on the servers sponsored by [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool).
